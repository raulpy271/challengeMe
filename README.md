# ðŸŽ® Challenge Me

To learn a new language I always try to solve a variety of programming problems.
So this repo is to put these solved problems in all languages that I'll learn or I learned.

I know that knowing the basics of a variety of languages can be nothing.
But it makes me feels less ignorant about the different ways to solve a problem.

## Problems solved

Here are some of the problems grouped by languages:

### Prolog

#### [Quicksort algorithm](prolog/quicksort.pl)

#### [Binary search](prolog/binarySearch.pl)

### Ocaml

#### [Population grow](ocaml/growthOfPopulation.ml)

#### [Calculating Pi](ocaml/nilakantha.ml)

### SQL 

#### [Null handling](sql/NullHandling.sql)

### Bash

#### [Add blurred background in video](bash/putInFullHD.sh)

### Java

#### [Unit test - Junit](java/)

### Python

#### [caching Fibonacci](python/memoized_fibonacci.py)

### BrainFuck

#### [Brainfuck generator](brainfuck/bf_generator.bf)
