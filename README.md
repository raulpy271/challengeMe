# ðŸŽ® Challenge Me

To learn a new language I always try to solve a variety of programming problems.
So this repo is to put these solved problems in all languages that I'll learn or I learned.

I know that knowing the basics of a variety of languages can be nothing.
But it makes me feels less ignorant about the different ways to solve a problem.

## Problems solved

Here are some of the problems ordered by languages:

### Prolog

#### [Quicksort algorithm](https://github.com/raulpy271/challengeMe/blob/main/prolog/quicksort.pl)

#### [Binary search](https://github.com/raulpy271/challengeMe/blob/main/prolog/binarySearch.pl)

### SQL 

#### [Null handling](https://github.com/raulpy271/challengeMe/blob/main/sql/NullHandling.sql)
